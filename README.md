This HTML code creates my resume in a web page format. It includes sections with my personal information, education, skills, work experience, and books of interest. I also add links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles. I use HTML to structure the content and CSS to style it, with placeholders for images and additional details about the projects and achievements I consider important.
