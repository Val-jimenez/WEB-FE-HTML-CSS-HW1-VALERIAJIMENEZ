            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>The list of the following projects are of interest as support for the choice of my final degree project.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiobjective Optimization Using Evolutionary Algorithms in Agile Teams Allocation (2019)</li>
                <p class="plist">Ensuring that the team meets project requirements is essential to ensure the software quality available in the market and the success of the project. In this context, this study evaluated three algorithms for optimizing software engineering problems: NSGAII, SPEA2 and MOCell, in order to support project managers in the composition of agile software development teams. These algorithms were tested in an experiment carried out in a software development company and evaluated in four projects recently executed by the company. The approach considered the characteristics of the project activities, available human resources, human resource profile, project constraints (scope and time for execution) and constraints established by the organization. The algorithms returned solutions with the number of resources needed to carry out the project, as well as resources such as more project qualification, lower cost, and productivity adequate for the term established by the client. The results showed that the three algorithms evaluated presented consistent performances. The NSGAII and SPEA2 had very similar results and behavior, whereas the MOCell presented a better performance in the computational effort and needed a larger population for its saturation.</p>
                <li>On Using Artificial Intelligence in the Search of the Best Professional Resumes (2022)</li>
                <p class="plist">Digital transformation has changed how companies develop, manufacture and deliver their products and services. The search for competitiveness and greater market share have been driven companies to use automation and digital technologies to become more attractive and continue to deliver value to their customers. However, the human factor remains decisive for the company´s success. In this context, the Human Resources (HR) team has the role of strategically improving the company composition. In this paper, we present the development of an application, based on Artificial Intelligence and Digital Data Processing tools, with the aim of helping HR teams to seek talents and, thereby, to contribute to the business success. This application was tested and validated by using real-world databases of professional resumes.</p>
                <li>Sentiment Analysis of Social Media: Techniques, Applications, and Reliability (2023)</li>
                 <p class="plist">Smart cities use big data analytics to enhance residents' liveability, health, and wellbeing. Engaging communities through social surveys and media like Twitter and Reddit requires advanced techniques. These platforms, rich in text content, are ideal for natural language processing. Analyzing social media data provides real-time sentiment insights for decision-makers. Word clouds offer qualitative analysis, while quantitative methods produce bar charts and sentiment time series. Accessing Twitter and Reddit APIs and using Python libraries for analysis are discussed, along with the potential bias from younger, progressive social media users.</p>
